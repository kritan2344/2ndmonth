        <h1>yaayyyyy, our second</h1>
        <p>Might have been old fashioned now. I coudn't think of any other thing special. You told me you were not going to be present on our day. SO in rush I had to plan this. The same thing I did earlier month. This time I wanted to list some songs I dedicated to you. Remember these are not just the songs, wich I dedicate to you. Every love and romantic songs I listen nowadays are all dedicated to you. I remember you whenever I listen those songs. Your eyes, your laughter, your smile somthing, I have been cherising for a quite while. I hope to do these kind of specail things for our every anniversery annd every special dau we have.<br> The first day I saw you since then I have been falling for you. And it's not your fault, falling for you was the easiest thing I could have done in my life.  Just see yourself who wouldn't fall for you. I love you every time of the day. I will really pray to god that no day crosses for me without talking with you. I hope all my desires with you fulfills. I hope to maryy u. Make you mine not only for this time but forever. Just take a peek inside my heart, it's all you. each cells, atoms, electron, quarks. With you I found the realest love. Let me share with you, Love is not like first love, second love it only happens once. When you get into it. It ends with that person. I have this strong feeling for you. When I was travelling from Nepal to USA, I sat down the seat to see down the plane and seeing those city lights, I remembered you. Your eyes, I saw a part of those sparks in that city lights. I have had never told you about this. Darling, I think I found my purest love in you. And I am very confident about my feelings. I love you saniii</p>
